#8 Implement Binary Search using recursion, compute space and time complexities, plot graph using asymptotic notations and compare two

# Start with two markers:
#     One at the beginning of the list (low)
#     One at the end of the list (high)
# While low is less than or equal to high:
#     Find the middle element (use (low + high) // 2)
#     If the middle element is the one you're looking for â€” boom! Found it.
#     If your target is greater than the middle element:
#         Search in the right half (low = mid + 1)
#     If your target is less than the middle element:
#         Search in the left half (high = mid - 1)
# Keep repeating until you either:
#     Find the element
#     Or the search range gets invalid (low > high), which means itâ€™s not in the list

# Time Complexity:
#     Best: O(1) (if element is at mid)
#     Average/Worst: O(log n)

# Space Complexity:
#     O(1) for iterative
#     O(log n) for recursive (due to call stack)
